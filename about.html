            <p>The drink was created by Dorset brewery Hall & Woodhouse in the 1980s and was originally named Arriva derived from the French ‘arriver’ which means to arrive.[1] In 1994, its name was changed to Rio Riva before being changed to simply Rio.[2] In 2013,
                 Dragon Rouge redesigned Rio in response to research that showed consumers knew the Rio name but didn't know much about the drink itself.</p>
            <p>Rio was redesigned again in 2017 by Pearlfisher taking inspiration from Brazilian street art to target a younger demographic.[4][5] The logo was changed as well, with the ‘O’ being turned into a sun to emphasise their slogan of "Celebrate the Sunny".[6] In June of the same year, they introduced 500ml PET bottles.[7] Brand manager Danielle Obbard said the new bottles were an integral part of their "plan for continued growth"</p>
            <p>In 2018, Rio began sponsoring racing car driver Bobby Thompson.[9] In 2021, Rio entered a partnership deal with Boost Drinks, with the company now overseeing the sales, marketing and distribution of Rio.</p>
